Simple Proof-Of-Concept implementation of Ministro. It uses a multiline textfield to display the arguments of
applications calling the service. It contains a very simple database for different Loader implementations
that can be extended using res/strings.xml values. This shows that Ministro's code is independent from that
of the Loader's - which is good. :) 

In order to properly build this project one needs to have the SDK and NDK
installed. Run the following commands to create the shared libraries:

android update project -p . -s
<ndk_root>/ndk-build

If the first command fails because it asks for a target then you need to
install the android-4 target.
